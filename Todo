- add arg passing in MethodInvoke where the first four args are also placed on the stack (find if this is required first)
- add methodinvoke for non win64 systems
- add runtime member reordering for runtime inheritance once dynamic type generation is allowed (field reordering) - will not add since types should not have child types which have members of the same name
- dynamic generic type generation
	- see JIT todo
- have loader support all valid modifiers for different attributes
- add static ctor support - this will either be done later or never
- remove switch case blocks in Loader that are always true or false
- Check MethodInfo::Invoke() on a method with more than 4 args
	- If stack space needs to be alloced for the call, execute `sub rsp, 32+((nargs-4)*8)`
		- add bytes back to rsp following the call
		- Probably shouldn't need stack space, just check if it works
		- Also check with large value type
	- Update ConstructorInfo::Invoke() accordingly
- Finish JIT
	- Fix GC to work with JIT assemblies (can you CONTEXT to get register values to also log as locals (or have JIT assemblies create a list of registers that are used for locals to log less))
	- Have ULR.Debugging.dll support reading JIT allocations & JIT interactions
	- Add jmp instrs
	- Attach vtable calls to method names somehow for jit compilation (e.g. create a mapping between name and number)
	- fix vtables somehow...
- TODO: pad all valuetypes to 8 bytes upon loading
- TODO: have JIT auto-create `this` as first arg for instance methods
- TODO: have JIT cache the postfill buffers so redundant ones are not allocated
	- Have JIT only use postfill when the address isn't available
	- Another memory opt -- since we have to allocate full pages anyway, maybe try to fit multiple functions on one page
	- use std::list to reduce number of large reallocations before full function page is allocated
- NOTE: MethodInfo::Invoke and JIT are not compatible with return values case 2 [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/x64-calling-convention?view=msvc-170#example-of-return-value-2---128-bit-result) (probably won't fix)
- Have support for executing with a JIT-only assembly (e.g. UIL binary)
	- TODO: have JIT only asms be able to specify deps

- IMPORTANT: exception throwing needs to be handled differently that C++ throwing
	- Or better yet... don't add exceptions at all!
		- Just have an error class in the stdlib with a bunch of error constants
- add JIT read-only API (no compile, like Loader::ReadNativeAssembly)
- IMPORTANT: FIX GC
- Use utf8 everywhere
- update readme
- Convert macros in headers to constexpr or inline functions
- have types store their own "storage sizes" for locals & heap allocs
- reminder: valtypes padded to 8 bytes for malloc store so that copies of them can be made irrespective of the size
	- do the same for heap allocs? (or no because user-defined methods should copy them)

- AllocL was removed because the compiler could just create a local for it (also, we can't keep this contract within a loop)
	- Usecase to add it back?
	- Removed AllocS also & replaced with NewS/NewL

- Make sure ULRAPI & JIT are compilant with Spec `ULF->Storage->Value Types`
	- MethodInfo::Invoke (and ctorinfo for that matter)
	- All JIT storage
	- ULRAPI boxing/unboxing
	- Native Loader (pad size)
	- JIT Loader (pad size)
